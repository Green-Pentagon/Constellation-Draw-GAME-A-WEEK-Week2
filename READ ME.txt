HOW TO PLAY:

Fill the endless* void of space with user-generated star constellations!


- Use WASD or arrow keys to control the player's movement.
- Use Left mouse button to add a point to your shape.
- Use Right mouse button to remove the most recent point from your shape (except origin).
- Once you've drawn a shape you are happy with, press enter to save it.
- The shape you have drawn will appear in the game the next time you start it.

The save information is stored in Users/.../AppData/LocalLow/DefaultCompany/Constellation Draw/save.dat


Known Bugs:
- Due to the way that Sprite Shapes in Unity operate, your line might disappear or begin flickering if it is too long: placing a point may resolve this issue, or simply make shapes out of smaller lines
- Origin point sadly cannot be moved by the player :<
- Starting position is limited, due to unknown bug causing the sprite shape to not render when starting far from origin.
